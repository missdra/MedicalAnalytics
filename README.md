### **Analysis of Medical Data on Diabetic Patients: Findings**

1. **Smoking and Ulcers:** 
   - While there is no direct evidence linking smoking as a cause of ulcers, the data suggests that non-smokers have a higher rate of ulcer healing compared to smokers. This indicates that smoking may hinder the recovery process.

2. **Heart Failure and Diabetes:**
   - A small percentage of diabetic patients experienced heart failure, predominantly within the age groups of 35-50 (Adults) and 51-69 (Boomers).

3. **Gender and Mortality:**
   - The data reveals a higher mortality rate in women compared to men when it comes to diabetes-related deaths.

4. **Amputation Outcomes:**
   - Despite undergoing amputations, 13% of patients still succumbed to the disease, highlighting the severity of diabetes even after surgical intervention.

5. **Age Group Prevalence:**
   - The highest prevalence of diabetes was found among the Boomers (ages 51-69), making this group the most affected by the condition.

6. **Gender and Amputation:**
   - Diabetes does not discriminate by gender, as the data shows an almost equal number of foot amputations in both male and female patients.
